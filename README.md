This app detects and censors your face using the FaceDetector API

How does it do this?

It takes feed from your webcam or selected camera, then it tracks where your face is in the video and pixelates it. 
You have options to set how scaled you want the pixelation to be.

It currently only works on Chrome. Plus you need to have 'Experimental Web Platform features' enabled for it to work.
